# what is CSS

CSS stands for cascading style sheet which used to give your HTML a style and to give it your ability to change your website layout and there are 3 main ways to apply it. the first is using inline which applied as an attribute in the HTML tags the second is to add a style tag to your head tag and finally to add a link tag that refers to a CSS file.

# main selectors

- using the tags and this will select every given tag and apply the given properties
- using classes, so you must add a dot before the class name like .love{bla bla bla}
- using ids, so you must add # before the class name like #love {bla bla bla}

# colors

## rgb values

r refers to red, g to green, and b refers to blue which is the mixture of any color in the world, and with RGB you give it the percentage of every color.
<br>
For example: rgb(100,100,90)

## hex codes

same as rgb but the syntax is different. Here we use hex numbers to define the percentages and before the number add # symbol
For example: #ee3e80

# predefined color

Just give the name as property and you will get the result
<br>
For example DarkCyan

- note: if you added color to the body tag that means you changed the default color for your website
- note in css3 rgba added and a indicate opacity.
