# functions

The function is a block of code that you can call it any time to perform a task.

xyz[key]

# pair programming

pair programming means to collaborate with another programer to enhance your work and think and do tasks together

## How does pair programming work?

- driver: its main job to focus on writing the code and directly interact with it
- navigator: its main job to give the driver the instructions and the ideas and to help him avoid mistakes

the pair programing will make your code take a little bit longer to write but will save time later by making less time to debug and test. Also, will make the programmers focus more and relay on each other. Also, each one has his skills pool when 2 share their skills they will learn from each other and give them more soft skills and make them work better with teams
