# notes to myself to stay in growth mindset:
1. When get a challenge dont panic stay positive and find out other ways of thinking to go through the problem.
2. Effort is over the talent, if you work harder you will gain better results and as they say no pain no gain.
3. Be positive when you meet someone who better than you. try to take them as inspiration and take them for advantage for yourself.
